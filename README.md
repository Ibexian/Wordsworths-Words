D3 Visualization of Wordsworths Poetry


Exercise in improving my D3 chops for a data visualization competition.

Using an array of word frequency and length of Wordsworth's collected works to generation a simple visualization - allowing the viewer to get a feel for the entire works at a glance.

[Resulting visualization is available here](http://williamkamovitch.com/projects/d3circles) (May take a while to load due to the size of the json file)
